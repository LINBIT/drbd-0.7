drbd (0.7.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a critical bug with Linux-2.4.x and HIGHMEM!
  * Fixed a bug that only showed up with the HIGHMEM problem on
    Linux-2.4.x -> It caused the resync process to starve.
  * The drbd.spec file now creates /dev/drbd in the post-install stage.
  * Fixed support for more than 2TB storage. Now DRBD supports up to
    3.99TB storage. It will also tell you, that it is not supported if
    you try to set up a bigger device.
  * Debian's build rules file now knows about the adjust_drbd_config_h.sh
    file.
  * DRBD_DISABLE_SENDPAGE available in drbd_config.h

drbd (0.7.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed minor bugs in the handling of the generation counters.
  * prevent possible in-kernel buffer overflow in drbd_proc.c
  * Fixed debian's postinst script to create /dev/drbd? instead of /dev/nb?
  * drbd status:
    be nice to heartbeat, include "OK" in output.
  * added FullSync meta data flag to read/write gc.pl
  * make the RHEL3 happy (page_count no longer in mm.h, but in mm_inline.h)
  * [Patch by Pavel Semerad]. Also use the drbd_devfs_name on Linux-2.4.x
  * fix missing dependencies on drbd_config.h

 -- Philipp Reisner <phil@linbit.com>  Fri, 27 Aug 2004 15:02:00 +0200

drbd (0.7.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Proper handling of backing storage devices that occasionally fail
    READA (=read ahead) requests. (E.g. LVM and MD)
  * DRBD now fails READA requests itself, if a resynchronisation is running
    and it would need to fetch the block from its peer.
  * "drbdadm adjust" had a race, which caused random errors. ( Missing
    waitpid() ). Fixed now.
  * Proper subtract SyncPause times from the syncer performance numbers.
  * Fix to the syncer progress bar in /proc/drbd.
  * Fix to debian build rules.

 -- Philipp Reisner <phil@linbit.com>  Fri, 6 Aug 2004 14:44:31 +0200

  * Fix for integer overflow in /proc/drbd syncer progress display
  * Longer timeouts in drbdadm for drbdsetup commands witch operate on
    meta data.
  * New major number 147 (officially registered at lanana.org).
  * Added a missing w_resume_next_wg() in case we stop syncing because
    of connection loss.
  * Fixed a Linux-2.2-ismus in recieve_data_tail(). Should considerably
    speed up protocols A and B.
  * Some work on vendor kernel compatibility

 -- Philipp Reisner <phil@linbit.com>  Fri, 30 Jul 2004 13:50:33 +0200

drbd (0.7.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * s/WriteHint/UnplugRemote/g
  * new module parameter major_nr to allow "arbitrary" major numbers
  * adjusted CTH to cope with that
  * fix copy'n'paste and conversion errors in initial bitmap handshake
  * warning "please upgrade me" if peer speaks (PRO_VERSION+1)
  * drbd_set_in_sync and drbd_set_out_of_sync are now macros
    calling to __*, giving file and line information,
    to be able to easily track causes of "strange state"s there.
  * rs_total is now != 0 only if we actually ARE syncing.
    it is reset
  * when sync is done
  * when connection is lost
  * when storage is lost on either node
    this way we can optimize and call drbd_set_in_sync only if rs_total != 0
    (and it feels somewhat more clean, too)
  * makefile adjusted to recognize svn revision and date tags
  * updates and fixes to the test helpers and bash test cases

 -- Philipp Reisner <phil@linbit.com>  Fri, 16 Jul 2004 10:13:33 +0200

  * Improvements in the way to deal with incompatible protocol releases.

drbd (0.6.10-3) unstable; urgency=low
  * Added back the drbd.postinst, drbd.postrm, and drbd.prerm scripts until
    I figure out why they aren't being handled by dh_installinit.
  * As of drbd-0.6.9, The drbd module no longer builds against just the
    kernel-headers package and now needs a full kernel-source tree.

 -- David Krovich <dkrovich@csee.wvu.edu>  Mon, 26 Jan 2004 00:32:49 -0500

drbd (0.6.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Put the datadisk in the correct location.  (Closes: Bug#221544)

drbd (0.6.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * With 0.6.9 there was a bug introduced which prevented the sending
    of ACK packets during resync. Fixed.
  * A fix to drbdsetup's wait_connect command.
  * Replaced all invocations of the sleep_on() family functions with the
    invocations of the wait_event() macros. This removes lost wakup events
    and race conditions.
  * New implementation of drbd_wait_ee(). This makes the
    "(BUG?) Moving bh=%p to done_ee" go away.
  * Handle the case if vmalloc() of the bitmap fails.

 -- Philipp Reisner <phil@linbit.com>  Thu, 12 Dec 2003 15:10:44 +0200

drbd (0.6.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New module build system (using kernel source tree build system)
  * New net section option 'ko-count'. It allows you to kick out a
    secondary node which does no longer process data in acceptable time.
    Its default value is 0 which disables this feature.
  * Changing syncgroups while resync runs has shows now the correct behaviour.
  * In case thread creations fails DRBD would deadlock on its own
    semaphore. Fixed now.
  * BKL is no longer used on Linux-2.4.x.
  * Now you can stack mapping block devices like LVM2 (and maybe md) on
    top of drbd (a one character fix).
  * drbdsetup wait_connect on a StandAlone node looked like a timeout and
    forced primary. fixed.
  * if drbdsetup wait_* in fact did timeout this looked like a failed ioctl.
    this bug was newly introduced in 0.6.8. fixed.
  * A fix to a race in _drbd_alloc_ee(). You could trigger this race if
    your filesystem uses a blocksize < 4K and your machine has multiple CPUs.
    By Eric W. Biederman.
  * A maybe bugfix regarding calls to free_page() by Eric W. Biederman.
  * A cleanup patch to drbd_process_done_ee() by Eric W. Biederman.

 -- Philipp Reisner <phil@linbit.com>  Mon, 20 Oct 2003 11:45:33 +0200

drbd (0.6.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * A fix to a bug that could cause data corruption if you use a
    other blocksize than 4k to access the DRBD device.
  * A fix to a SMP race in the syncer code. The problem was tirggered
    when using DRBD on QLogic fiber channel adapters.
  * Replaced various calls to sleep_on() variants with the wait_event()
    macros. -- This removes potential (, non-critical) SMP races.
  * This release includes the sync-group option.

 -- Philipp Reisner <phil@linbit.com>  Thu, Oct 13 2003 11:17:27 +0200

drbd (0.6.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * In the 0.6.5 release the secondary_remote command was badly broken,
    it succeeded when it should fail silently. This is fixed now.
  * Probabely in all previous releases, the resyncer thread did not
    exit properly if the secondary node goes away during resync.
    This was not fatal sind the resyncher thread did exit at soon
    as it gets a network error. This is fixed now.
  * Some new switches to the drbd script.

 -- Philipp Reisner <phil@linbit.com>  Mon, 28 Jul 2003 14:40:43 +0200

drbd (0.6.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Improvements to the build system
  * Now it is possible to tune the socket send buffer size via drbdsetup/
    drbd.conf. This is especially usefull for WAN mirroring / using
    protocol A.
  * Compatibility code to compile DRBD under RedHat 9.0 (RH's version of
    Linux-2.4.20)
  * Improved sample drbd.conf file

    different bash releases)

 -- Philipp Reisner <phil@linbit.com>  Thu, 01 May 2003 21:00:00 +0100

drbd (0.6.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Lockup of primary if secondary fails during resync. Fixed. (Stupid!)
  * Probabely SMP only deadlock in the drop-conection code path.
  * Improved connect code. (The old code could trap into a distributed
    deadlock, resulting in an endless connect/disconnect loop.)
  * The 'BitMap too small bug' was actually caused by a patch in
    SuSE's distribution kernel. This patch makes DRBD 'more' compatible
    with SuSE's kernel.
  * Improved code to allocate buffers for the rsynchronisation process.
    The old code allocated physical adjacent pages although the syncer
    does not need them! The old code could fail under high memory pressure.
